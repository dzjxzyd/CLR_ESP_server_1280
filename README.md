just a note for future users who are interested in build a webserver with Flask and Gunicorn, but meet error like:
In my case it is AttributeError: Can't get attribute 'Contrastive_learning_layer' on <module '__main__' from

some online available errors like: 
"AttributeError: Can't get attribute 'Net' on <module '__main__' despite adding class definition inline"
“AttributeError: Can't get attribute on <module '__main__' from 'manage.py'>”
“AttributeError: Can't get attribute 'tokenizer' on <module '__main__'>”

etc.

I would highly recommend this repository and I refer to this [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55488795/unpickling-saved-pytorch-model-throws-attributeerror-cant-get-attribute-net) (really appreciated)
